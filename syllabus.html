        <h2>Course Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>If you have been admitted to the CS Bridge program then you meet the prerequisites for this course. You should have completed the equivalent of one semester of an introductory programming class in any language. This courses uses Java, so if you studied a language other than Java you will need to be prepared to come up to speed quickly with Java syntax. </p>

        <p>If you have significant experience programming in Java speak with the professor about the possibility of transferring to a more advanced course. You will need to provide the instructor with evidence that you have implemented a program of more than 2,000 lines of code that uses arrays, inheritance, external libraries, concurrency, web technologies, and contains complex logic.</p>

        <h2>Course Materials</h2>
        <p>There is no required text for this class, however it is recommended that you get an introductory Java book as a reference. The <a href="http://www.deitel.com/Books/Java/JavaHowtoProgram8eEarlyObjectsVersion/tabid/3415/Default.aspx">Java How to Program</a> series by Deitel and Deitel is recommended.</p>

        <p>
         Links to online resources, including notes, code samples, and external resources, will be posted on the <a href="/schedule.html">Schedule</a> page. Make sure to check the schedule early and often.
       </p>	

       <h2>Course Announcements</h2> 

       <p>
         Announcements will be posted on <a href="https://cs514-f17.slack.com/">Slack</a>. Questions about assignments and projects should be posted on Slack. Students are responsible for staying current on all course announcements.
       </p>

       <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>     
       <p>
         At the end of this course, successful students will be able to do all of the following:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Independently design programs</li>
        <li>Produce professional-quality code</li>
        <li>Implement large programs of greater than 2.5k lines of code</li>
        <li>Design and execute tests to identify software bugs</li>
        <li>Repair software bugs, redesigning and refactoring code when necessary</li>
        <li>Utilize, analyze, and critique code written by others</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Course Requirements</h2> 

      <h4>Homework Assignments</h4>
      <p>Weekly programming assignments will be due most weeks. You may be given class time to work on these assignments, allowing you to get help from the instructor. If you do not finish these assignments in class you will need to complete them on your own time. You may always seek help during office hours.</p>

      <h4>Laboratory Assignments</h4>
      <p>You will have three substantial laboratory assignments. It is expected that these assignments will take you two to three weeks to complete and you should work on them in parallel with your homework assignments. Labs are graded on two criteria: functionality and design. This course places significant emphasis on code quality and it is not sufficient to have a working solution. Functionality is worth 85% of the final lab grade and design is worth 15% of the final lab grade. By the functionality deadline your solution must pass all provided test cases in order for your solution to be eligible to receive any credit for design. If your solution passes all test cases, the instructor or TA will conduct a thorough code review and provide feedback on design improvements that must be completed by the design deadline. If you satisfactorily address all issues identified during code review then your solution will be eligible for the remaining 15% of the score. Points may be deducted for failing to address open issues. See the following for detailed information about the <a href="https://github.com/CS514-F17/notes/blob/master/Admin/labsubmission.md">Laboratory Submission Procedure</a></p>

      <h4>Projects</h4>
      <p>You will have one large capstone project that will be completed in three releases during the last third of the semester. For the project, this course uses <i>mastery learning</i>. This means that each release must demonstrate mastery and be worthy of 100% before the next release may be attempted. Once functionality requirements are complete, the instructor or TA will meet with you for an in-person code review. You must make all changes required during code review, making sure that your solution still passes all functionality requirements, before your solution will be reviewed again. This process will repeat until your solution demonstrates mastery. You may resubmit your design for the next code review a maximum of once per week. By the final deadline during the finals week, you must demonstrate mastery for two of three releases and meet the functionality requirements for the third release. See the following for detailed information about the <a href="https://github.com/CS514-F17/notes/blob/master/Admin/projectsubmission.md">Project Submission Procedure</a></p>
      
      <h4>Exams</h4>
      <p>The exam portion of your grade will be based on two exams administered throughout the semester and one exam administered during the final exam period. Make sure to note the exam policy below. You are responsible for being in class on the day of the exam. Make-up exams will be given only in the case of a medical emergency verified by a doctor's note.</p>

      <h4>Participation and Quizzes</h4>
      <p>You are expected to attend class, participate in class discussion, and participate in online discussion on Slack. Pop quizzes may be administered any time. If you are not in class on the day of the quiz you will receive a 0 for the quiz.</p>

      <h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>

      <p>The final grade for this course will be calculated as follows:</p>

      <p>10% Homework</p>
      <p>15% Labs</p>
      <p>25% Project (3 parts) </p>
      <p>20% Midterm Exams (10% each)</p>
      <p>20% Final Exam</p>
      <p>10% Participation and Quizzes</p>

      <p>Please note that this is a tentative breakdown and subject to change.</p>

      <h2>Exam Policy</h2>
      <p>If a student earns less than 60% on any two out of the three exams the student will get an automatic F for the class.</p>

      <h2>Project Policy</h2>
      <p>If a student does not (1) demonstrate mastery for two of three project releases <strong>and</strong> (2) meet the functionality requirements for release three the student will get an automatic F for the class.</p>

      <h2>Code Review Policy</h2>
      <p>An in-person code review will be required for all three project releases and may be required for any lab. A student who does not meet with the instructor for a code review in a timely manner will be given a <strong>0</strong> on the assignment in question. A student who is unable to explain his/her code and answer the instructor's questions about his/her code as expected may receive a deduction of <i>up to</i> <strong>100%</strong>, resulting in a 0 on the assignment.</p>

      <h2>Letter Grades</h2> 
      <p>Letter grades will be assigned according to the following scale:</p>

      <table class="table table-condensed" style="text-align:left;">
       <tr>
        <td>A+ ≥100%</td>
        <td>B+ ≥87%</td>
        <td>C+ ≥77%</td>
        <td>D+ ≥67%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      </tr>
      <td>A ≥94%</td>
      <td>B ≥84%</td>
      <td>C ≥74%</td>
      <td>D ≥64%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>A- ≥90%</td>
      <td>B- ≥80%</td>
      <td>C- ≥70%</td>
      <td>D- ≥60%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>F < 60%</td>
    </tr>

  </table>

  For example, you will receive a C letter grade if your grade is greater than or equal to 74% and less than 77%. Please note this scale is subject to change. See the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/catalog/regulations/student/">Undergraduate Student Regulations</a> for more information about letter grades and how they are translated into GPA.  

  <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
  <p>Students are expected to be on-time to all classes. Attendance is mandatory for all exams, quizzes, labs, and exercises. Exam dates will be posted on the course <a href="/schedule.html">schedule</a>. Topics that are discussed in class but are not in the course notes or lecture notes, might be included on the midterms and final. 
  </p>

  <h2>Late Policy</h2>
  <p>All deadlines and exam dates are firm. No late homeworks or quizzes will be accepted. Laboratory assignments must pass all test cases by the functionality deadline and all design changes must be made by the design deadline. Project releases may be submitted once per week until the last day of the final exam week and no more than one release may be submitted per week.
  </p>
  <p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of <i>verifiable</i> medical or family emergency. Extensions and makeup exams must be arranged <i>PRIOR</i> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

  <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>

  <p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the University of San Francisco's Academic Honor Code. Go to <a href="https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code</a> for details.</p>

  <p>You must never represent another person’s work as your own. Any student may be asked to reproduce any of his/her work at any time. Failure to reproduce work in a timely manner will be considered academic dishonesty.</p>

  <p>Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project or homework assignment is a violation of the university’s honor code.This includes copying code or other material from the web, and having anyone other than yourself complete your assignments. It also includes working too closely with another student. Collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar code indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your solution and is a violation of the honor code.</p>

  <p>Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the University Academic Integrity Committee, and a report to the Dean.</p>
  <p>At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and any violation may result in an F in the course.</p>

  <p>Examples of honor code violations include but are not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Giving your code to another student.</li>
   <li>Submitting code written by anyone other than yourself as your own.</li>
   <li>Copying text from the web.</li>
   <li>Discussing implementation details of a solution with another student.</li>
   <li>Discussing code-specific details of a solution with another student.</li>    	    
 </ul>
